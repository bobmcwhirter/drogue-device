== stm32u585ai-iot02a-blinky drogue-device example

This example application runs out of the box on the STM32U585AI-IOT02A development kit.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* STM32 U585AI-IOT02A development kit.
* A finger or other stick-like device to push a button.

==== Software

* To build the example, you need to have link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup].
* To flash the example on the device, you need `probe-run` installed (`cargo install probe-run`).

==== Running

To run the firmware:

....
cargo run --release
....

== Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is powered).

....
cargo run --release -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....

Once flashed, the device will reset and look no different at first. 
Upon pressing the blue user button, the LEDS will cycle from green to blue to red and back again.
